### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    List your current skills and areas of expertise:

    - Communication
    - Extensive customer service background
    - Quick, visual learner
    - Good at spotting areas of improvement

2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    Describe your key interests related to your career:
    - I would like to apply my background in customer service to create better user experiences for engaging with websites.
    - As I have a background in aviation and have familiarity with the medical industry, being able to apply my software development skills to a career in either one of those fields would be the most intriguing to me.
    - Having a young child that will grow up in the digital world, I also have an interest in cyber-protection of minors. I'm not sure if this is something I am interested in exploring yet, but its possible that I may want to explore this at a later stage.

    What values are important to you in a work environment?:

    (1) Flexibility in schedule <br>
    (2) Work-Life balance / Understanding of familial commitments <br>
    (3) Vacation time off <br>
    (4) Remote work for digital nomad lifestyle <br>
    (5) Money 

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    List the industries or roles you have researched.
    - Healthcare 
    - Aviation 
    - Film industry software developer
    - Influencer websites

    Note any particular areas that piqued your interest.
    - Hospital Management System 
    - Electronic Health Record System
    - Aviation crew scheduling
    - Airline websites and travel planning
    - Using software development for Special Effects in movies

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    Reflect on how these industries/roles align with your skills, interests, and values:
    - Being able to work in the aviation industry would be very exciting for me as I have worked as an international flight attendant for 8 years. Because I understand what its like to be on the receiving end of the software, or lack thereof, I have the advantage of knowing what is missing, or areas in which they can be improved upon. I know I can easily apply my communication and customer service skills in this industry.

    - There is lots of flexibility in your schedule, time off for familial obligations, as well as decent pay in both the aviation and film industries. <br>

    Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration:
    - I'm not quite sure yet on how remote one's work can be in any of these fields, except the healthcare one. I will have to explore this further by looking at more job offers and reading specific requirement listings.
    - I also need to do more research to see how flexible one's schedule can be in the healthcare industry, ideally by speaking to other software developers in the healthcare industry.

    - The medical industry can be challenging to break into because it often requires some formal education in the field. Even in the case of software development, they usually look for a bachelors degree in software. It might be worth exploring that option at some stage if I decide that is the path I wish to follow.  


### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals:
    - Dedicate 2 hours every saturday to working on these career goals or improving coding areas I think I am lacking knowledge or confidence in. 
    - Learn other coding languages. Potentially:
     C/ C++, Python, and Node JS.
     Most of the job offers I saw required some background knowledge in these languages. I need to explore these languages further to see which ones I think would be most relevant.
     
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    Outline your long-term career aspirations:
    - I would like to be able to work from anywhere in the world as my family and I intend to move quite a bit in the next few years. Having a fully remote career that allows me to work whenever I choose to, as opposed to the standard 9-5 work hours, would be ideal. That way I can be based anywhere, work at decent hours to my local time, whilst potentially being employed in a foreign country different to my physical location.

    - Having the freedom of remote work and a flexible schedule would allow me to dictate when I work, which in turn allows me to dedicate when I can spend time with my family. It would allow me to choose when I want to take a holiday or time off from work, and ideally allow me to choose to work in a country that pays better.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    Detail specific actions or steps needed to achieve each short-term goal:
    - Once I conclude this course with CodeSpace, I will re-examine how confident I am in my Javascript abilities. If I feel I need more practice, I will do some more courses, such as the ones offered on Scrimba. 
    - Once I am completely comfortable with front-end developer languages and tools, I will try and see what sort of job roles I can get with only that. This will allow me to build up my confidence in coding while hopefully earning.
    - Once I have completed my course, I will spend time researching the other languages to see which ones I would be able to learn, as well as which would benefit me the most. 
    - If I find that that isn't enough to land a decent job, I will invest time into learning Python, potentially through another coding school or Bootcamp like Udemy.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    Describe the preparations or groundwork necessary for your long-term aspirations:
    - Time. The more time I spend developing personal projects, the better my digital "CV" looks. As I don't have a formal education in software development, I know I will have to prove I am capable of creating projects needed by presenting my own work. I will need to dedicate personal time to creating these projects, ensuring that I have the work time scheduled on a weekly basis so that I am making progress on said projects, as well as keeping the coding knowledge updated in my head.
    - Work experience. This goes hand-in-hand with the previous point. The more relevant work experience I can demonstrate, the better. It will help with my overall coding confidence, which in turn will help me feel more capable of learning a new skill / language.
    It is possible that I may have to get a formal Software development or computer science degree if I find that my career foals are not achievable with just work experience, but that is a potential long-tem goal.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.
    - Time & money. As I have familial obligations, I don't know how much free time I can dedicate to learning another language whilst also working full-time.

    Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.
    - I will create a schedule with my husband whereby I dedicate time to focusing on learning other software languages and skills whilst he handles child-care and household duties. 
    - If I can find short-term freelance work, this will give me time between jobs to focus on studying and working on other areas and projects.

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Being more engaging with the Community Fridays team members.
    - Finding out from others in the industry how important it is to have a formal education in Software Development or if work experience is sufficient. 
    - Finding out on sites like Reddit what steps and programming knowledge is needed to break into the industries mentioned, or what the best route to follow is if you're looking to be a completely freelance software developer.
